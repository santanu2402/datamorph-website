interface ComponentNameProps {
  prop1: string;
  prop2?: number;
}

const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentNameProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState<string>('');

  // Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);

  // Handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handler logic
  };

  // Render
  return (
    <div className="component-name">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

    throw new Error(error.response?.data?.message || 'Error message');
  }
};
