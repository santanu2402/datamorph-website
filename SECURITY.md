# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of DataMorph Website seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please do NOT:

- Open a public GitHub issue
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please DO:

1. **Email us directly** at security@datamorph.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

2. **Allow us time** to respond and fix the issue before public disclosure

3. **Provide your contact information** so we can follow up with you

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Updates**: We will send you regular updates about our progress
- **Timeline**: We aim to patch critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. **Access Codes**: Use strong, unique access codes
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor your application for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
   ```typescript
   const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;
   ```

3. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input
4. **CORS**: Configure CORS properly for your domain
5. **Authentication**: Implement proper server-side authentication

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Client-Side Authentication**: The current access code is validated client-side
   - **Risk**: Can be bypassed by inspecting code
   - **Recommendation**: Implement server-side authentication for production

2. **API Endpoint**: API endpoint is exposed in client code
   - **Risk**: Endpoint is publicly visible
   - **Recommendation**: Use environment variables and implement API authentication

3. **Session Storage**: Authentication state is stored in sessionStorage
   - **Risk**: Vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - **Recommendation**: Implement httpOnly cookies with server-side sessions

### Recommended Production Security

1. **Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT authentication**
2. **Use HTTPS/SSL certificates**
3. **Implement rate limiting**
4. **Add API key authentication**
5. **Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
6. **Enable DDoS protection**
7. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
8. **Regular security audits**
